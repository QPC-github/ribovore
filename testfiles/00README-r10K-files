There are 3 files in this directory that are meant to be used for
timing experiments.

These files were created by randomly sampling sequences from GenBank
as follows:

r.10K.ssu.16S.fa: random sample of 10,000 sequences from the set of
                  8,161,145 sequences that are returned with an Entrez
                  query of "16S and 200:1799[Sequence Length]"^(see
                  note below) fetched on May 10, 2017.

r.10K.ssu.18S.fa: random sample of 10,000 sequences from the set of
                  1,047,738 sequences that are returned with an Entrez
                  query of "18S and 200:2209[Sequence Length]"^(see
                  note below) fetched on May 11, 2017.

r.10K.lsu.23S.fa: random sample of 10,000 sequences from the set of
                  2,267,777 sequences that are returned with an Entrez
                  query of "23S and 200:3529[Sequence Length]"^(see
                  note below) fetched on May 11, 2017.
