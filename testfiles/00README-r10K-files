The following file was created by randomly sampling sequences from GenBank
as follows:

r.10K.ssu.16S.fa: random sample of 20,000 sequences was taken from the
                  set of 8,161,145 sequences that are returned with an
                  Entrez query of "16S and 200:1799[Sequence
                  Length]"^(see note below) fetched on May 10, 2017. I
                  then ran these through ribosensor-wrapper.pl and
                  saved those that 'passed'. From these 15,233 I
                  randomly selected 10,000 and saved them to
                  r.10K.ssu.16S.fa.
