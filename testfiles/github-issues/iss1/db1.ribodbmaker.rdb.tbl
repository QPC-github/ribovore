# Column  2: 'seqname': name of sequence
# Column  3: 'seqlen':  length of sequence
# Column  4: 'staxid':  taxid of sequence (species level), '-' if all taxid related steps were skipped
# Column  5: 'otaxid':  taxid of sequence (order level), '-' if all taxid related steps were skipped
# Column  6: 'ctaxid':  taxid of sequence (class level), '-' if all taxid related steps were skipped
# Column  7: 'ptaxid':  taxid of sequence (phylum level), '-' if all taxid related steps were skipped

# Column  9: 'clust':   'R' if sequence selected as representative of a cluster, 'NR' if not
# Column 10: 'special': '-' for all sequences because --special not used
# Column 11: 'failstr': '-' for PASSing sequences, else list of reasons for FAILure, see below
